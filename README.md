# Bank-Customer-Churn
Bank Customer Churn Data analysis using Python and PowerBI

#Description of the project
The project "Bank Customer Data for Customer Churn" aims to analyze factors influencing customer churn in a bank. By examining various attributes such as credit score, geography, age, tenure, balance, and customer behavior, the project seeks to identify patterns that contribute to customers leaving the bank. Understanding these factors enables the development of strategies such as loyalty programs and retention campaigns to mitigate churn and maintain customer loyalty, ultimately reducing the cost of acquiring new clients.
